| Jan 14  | 11:00-11:20 |                                                                                                                Looked over the problem set and starting to brainstorm |
| Jan 15  |  9:05-9:55  |                                                                                          Discussed with Diego and Mr.Blick how to make a good algorithm started on it |
| Jan 15  | 10:00-10:20 |                                                                                                                                                           Finished it |
| Jan 15  | 11:00-11:30 |                                                                                          Starting brainstorming and implementing ways to make the code more efficient |
| Jan 16  | 10:00-10:40 |                                                                                                              Idk how to make this more efficient T-T. This is so hard |
| Jan 21  |  1:20-1:50  |                                                                                                                          Started to work on making a adjacency matrix |
| Jan 22  | 10:00-10:30 | Finished the rest of the find longest run recursive function. It passes all the tests, but it slower than my first attempt which is interesting, but it works so Yay. |
